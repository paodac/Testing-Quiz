# 19 Testing: Tech Quiz Test Suite

## Description

This project focuses on showcasing the importance of testing to ensure the reliability and robustness of modern web applications. The goal is to implement component tests and end-to-end tests using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) for a Tech Quiz application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).

The application allows users to take a quiz of 10 questions and view their final score.
